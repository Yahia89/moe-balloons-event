# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a responsive mobile navigation menu to the Moe Balloons Event website. Currently, the navigation menu is only visible on desktop screens (md breakpoint and above), leaving mobile users without access to navigation links. This enhancement will implement a hamburger menu button that toggles a mobile-friendly navigation overlay on smaller screens.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user visiting the Moe Balloons Event website, I want to access the navigation menu through a hamburger button, so that I can navigate to different sections of the site on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen width is below the md breakpoint (768px) THEN the system SHALL display a hamburger menu button in the navigation bar
2. WHEN the hamburger menu button is clicked THEN the system SHALL open a mobile navigation overlay
3. WHEN the mobile navigation overlay is open THEN the system SHALL display all navigation links (Home, Services, Gallery, Reviews, Contact)
4. WHEN a navigation link is clicked in the mobile overlay THEN the system SHALL close the overlay and navigate to the corresponding section
5. WHEN the mobile overlay is open and the user clicks outside the menu THEN the system SHALL close the overlay

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the mobile navigation to be visually consistent with the desktop design, so that I have a cohesive brand experience across all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mobile navigation overlay is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same color scheme and typography as the desktop navigation
2. WHEN navigation links are displayed in mobile overlay THEN the system SHALL maintain the same hover effects and styling as desktop links
3. WHEN the Contact button is displayed in mobile overlay THEN the system SHALL maintain the gradient styling consistent with the desktop version

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want smooth animations when opening and closing the mobile menu, so that I have a polished user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hamburger menu is toggled THEN the system SHALL animate the menu icon transformation (hamburger to X)
2. WHEN the mobile overlay opens THEN the system SHALL slide in smoothly from the top or side
3. WHEN the mobile overlay closes THEN the system SHALL animate out smoothly
4. WHEN navigation links appear in the mobile overlay THEN the system SHALL stagger their appearance for a polished effect

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the mobile navigation to be accessible, so that I can use it with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hamburger button is focused THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels
2. WHEN the mobile overlay is open THEN the system SHALL trap focus within the navigation menu
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL allow closing the menu with the Escape key
4. WHEN the mobile overlay is open THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA attributes for screen readers
